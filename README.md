# Task management server
  
This project implements a REST API endpoint for a task management system.   
Front-end should soon be in a separate repo (uses React + React-Query).  

**Purpose of the project**: 
- To re-develop my Golang skills, and package knowledge. 
- Learn folder structuring + package distrubution
- Apply middleware and MVC concepts 

**How to use/ test**:
- Clone the repo
- Set up a postgres database and .env file
- run $go build ** ./restApi
